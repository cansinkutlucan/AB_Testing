# AB_Testing
Today, I complete a project about AB Testing. Unfortunately, I can't share dataset information due to legal reasons. Please see below for the information regarding  our data.
Facebook introduced a new type of bid named average bidding, as an alternative they introduced maximum bidding. Company wants to do an A/B test to see if averagebidding converts more than maximumbidding.
There are 2 datasets named 'control' and 'test' and have same column names. These datasets represents 'average bidding' and 'maximum bidding' information.
Variables: Impression, Click, Purchase, Earning
